# Fusion Sripts

My collection of Blackmagic Fusion scripts.

## Installation

To run script files you need Python 2 (64-bit) installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2717/)

Put script files to %appdata%\Roaming\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Scripts\Comp

## How to use

In Blackmagic Fusion select Script tab in the main toolbar and select the script you want to run. Some scripts requires that you have selected some nodes / tools.
